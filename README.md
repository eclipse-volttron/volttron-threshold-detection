# volttron-threshold-detection
The ThresholdDetectionAgent will publish an alert when a value published to a topic exceeds or falls below a configured
value.

The agent subscribes to the topics listed in the configuration file and publishes alerts when the callback receives a 
value for the point above the max (if configured) or below the min (if configured) corresponding to the point in the
configuration file.

# Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

    ```shell
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
2. Install volttron and start the platform.

    ```shell
    pip install volttron

    # Start platform with output going to volttron.log
    volttron -vv -l volttron.log &
    ```

3. Install the threshold detection library.
    ```shell
    pip install volttron-threshold-detection
    ```
4. Setup your configuration file. 


* The Threshold Detection agent supports observing individual point values from their respective topics or from a device's
    all publish.  Points to watch are configured as JSON key-value pairs as follows:

    * Key:  The key is the point topic for the point to watch, or the device's "all" topic if watching points from the all 
    publish (i.e. "devices/campus/building/device/point" or "devices/campus/building/device/all" if using the all topic)

    * Value:  Using point topic: JSON object specifying the min ('threshold_min') and max ('threshold_max) threshold values 
    for the point.  Only one of the thresholds are required, but both may be used.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
        "point0": {
            "threshold_max": 10,
            "threshold_min": 0
        },
        "point1": {
            "threshold_max": 42
        }
    }
    ```

    Using device "all" topic:  JSON object with the key as the point name and value being the threshold object described
    above

    Example

    ```json
    {
        "devices/some/device/all": {
            "point0": {
                "threshold_max": 10,
                "threshold_min": 0
            },
            "point1": {
                "threshold_max": 42
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Example configuration:

    ```json
    {
        "devices/fake/fakedevice/all": {
            "OutsideAirTemperature1": {
                "threshold_max": 60,
                "threshold_min": 0
            },
            "OutsideAirTemperature2": {
                "threshold_max": 42
            }
        }
    }
    ```
5. After creating your configuration file. install and start threshold detection in VOLTTRON.

    ```shell
    vctl install volttron-threshold-detection --agent-config <path to config> --vip-identity platform.threshold_detection --start --force
    ```

### Example Publish

This example publish uses the example config above along with a fake driver running on the platform.

```
Peer: pubsub
Sender: platform.threshold_detection
Bus:
Topic: alerts/ThresholdDetectionAgent/None_platform_threshold-detection
Headers: {'alert_key': 'devices/fake/fakedevice/all', 'min_compatible_version': '3.0', 'max_compatible_version': ''}
Message: ('{"status": "BAD", "context": '
 '"devices/fake/fakedevice/all(OutsideAirTemperature2) value (50.0)is above '
 'acceptable limit (42)", "last_updated": "2023-11-13T20:30:10.025105+00:00"}')
```
